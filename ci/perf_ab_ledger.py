"""The CLAUDE.md rule-12 ledger, computed from perf-ab samples (#573 B4).

Rule 12: memory buys CPU at 3:1 and nothing else is free.

- Memory credit: `saved%` = (baseline - candidate) / (baseline - ideal) of the cell's peak RSS,
  where `ideal` is the RSS floor (the process's RSS before the work plus the live requested bytes,
  which ci/perf_ab.c prints).
- Allowed CPU (and throughput) regression on that cell = `saved% / 3`.
- A cell whose RSS did not fall (a control) allows none beyond perf-ab's noise.
- The verdict is PASS when the whole interval of the regression lies within the allowance, FAIL
  when the whole interval lies beyond it, and INCONCLUSIVE otherwise (rerun; it is not a pass).

Everything here works on the per-repetition samples, so it can be re-run on the JSON artifact.
